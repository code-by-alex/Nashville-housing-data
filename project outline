Project Overview: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning and Organization

The primary objective of this project was to download and clean the Nashville Housing dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data.). The dataset required meticulous cleaning to ensure its readiness for subsequent in-depth analysis. The focus of this project was to showcase proficiency in data cleaning and organization within a MySQL environment.

Cleaning Steps:

Formatting Issues: 
The initial dataset exhibited formatting issues that needed attention. This involved ensuring consistency and standardization across the entire dataset.

Column Renaming: 
To enhance clarity and usability, certain columns were renamed for a more intuitive and descriptive representation.

Duplicate Column Removal: 
Identifying and eliminating duplicate columns to streamline the dataset and prevent redundancy.

Data Separation: 
In cases where information was aggregated in a single column, efforts were made to separate and distribute the data into multiple columns, enabling a more granular analysis.

New Column Updates: 
Introducing new columns when necessary to accommodate additional insights or enhance data representation.

Verification of Updates:
 Rigorous verification processes were implemented to ensure that all modifications and updates were accurately reflected in the dataset.

Irrelevant Data Removal: Elimination of data that was deemed unnecessary for the specific analysis goals, contributing to a more focused and efficient dataset.
